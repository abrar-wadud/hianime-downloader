00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.303
I have to beat him at everything! 
Otherwise, I'll... I'll...

00:00:06.563 --> 00:00:09.663
Hey, the match is over.

00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:11.813
Wh-What's he doing?

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.613
Disappear.

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:32.293
Finral!

00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:33.673
These wounds are awful.

00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:34.963
At this rate...

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:36.383
Hey!

00:00:37.053 --> 00:00:39.383
Just try and do something else.

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:43.223
Forget the match. We'll kill you.

00:00:43.223 --> 00:00:44.353
You bastard...

00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:46.303
How dare you do that to Finral?!

00:00:47.323 --> 00:00:49.613
Th-This is too awful!

00:00:50.103 --> 00:00:52.103
You actually pissed me off.

00:00:52.103 --> 00:00:53.603
I won't forgive you!

00:00:54.073 --> 00:00:55.233
Oh?

00:00:55.563 --> 00:00:57.603
There's something wrong with you!

00:00:58.063 --> 00:01:00.263
The match was already over!

00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:35.793
Petit Clover

00:02:32.063 --> 00:02:34.573
Petit Clover!

00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:39.293
Hairstyle

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.283
Hairstyle.

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:43.633
That new spell is awesome! 
Fallen Angel's Weightlifting!

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:46.143
That's Fallen Angel's Wingbeat.

00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:49.093
I mean, I know when I need to get tough.

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:50.943
It's the result of trying different things.

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:56.853
So is your new hairstyle also 
from trying different things?

00:02:56.853 --> 00:02:58.183
Oh, really?

00:02:58.183 --> 00:02:59.403
Huh? Wait, no...

00:02:59.403 --> 00:03:02.083
I'm sure you tried out a regent pompadour.

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:04.893
As well as Captain Yami's hairstyle.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.153
And soft serve hair, la!

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:08.193
That's pooâ€”

00:03:08.193 --> 00:03:10.243
This looks pretty strong!

00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:13.043
If you do Marie's hairstyle, I'll kill you.

00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:15.923
I-I like this hairstyle.

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:18.963
I think this one is better.

00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:21.143
I-It's just a better option, that's all.

00:03:21.143 --> 00:03:22.913
How about something a bit more mature?

00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:25.763
This is the hairstyle for when 
you go beyond your limits!

00:03:25.763 --> 00:03:27.503
Uh, seriously...

00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:31.893
I wanted to see this 
hairstyle on you, Finral!

00:03:31.893 --> 00:03:35.423
When it comes to me in this series, 
my hair should be the least of your worries!

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.233
Praise me!

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:41.983
Your daring and resolute king presents...

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:48.903
