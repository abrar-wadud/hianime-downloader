00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.250
<i>It appeared as though humanity 
would be destroyed by the demons.</i>

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.430
<i>But a single mage saved them all.</i>

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.730
<i>He was called the Wizard King,
and he became a legend.</i>

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.320
<i>It's the first round of the second stage 
of the Royal Knights Selection Exam.</i>

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.320
<i>Sol's attack left Mimosa unable to move.</i>

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.650
<i>Asta was forced to face off with Magna, 
who came to attack their crystal on his own.</i>

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.540
<i>Also...</i>

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.420
What do you think you're doing without me?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.590
<i>Crap! I'm not gonna be able 
to take both of them on!</i>

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.960
<i>The one who saved Asta was a 
mysterious mage named Xerx.</i>

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.680
Attack the cherry blossom guy,
you little shit!

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.550
I'll take care of this in an instant!

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.060
And that instant's all I need!

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.350
<i>With the help of Mimosa's plant spell that 
lets her control the enemy's movements,</i>

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.430
<i>Asta and the rest of B Team 
were able to claim victory.</i>

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.290
<i>And now, the destined battle between the
brothers Finral and Langris is about to begin.</i>

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.170
<b>Special Little Brother
 vs.
 Failed Big Brother</b>

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.980
There you go.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.880
Th-Thank you, Vanessa.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.360
That's perfect! You look awesome!

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.320
Could you do mine, too?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.390
You already lost, though.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.470
It looks fine. You look like 
the failure that you are.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.940
What?! Who're you calling a failure?!

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.870
Now, now. Try to stay calm, Magna.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.340
Like a loser should.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.440
You bastard! I'm gonna kill you!

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.840
I'm so gonna kill you!

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.680
Good! Let's do this now!

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.040
Wait, you guys—

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.940
As I thought, that guy is a very 
skilled flame magic caster.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.790
The lightning guy is also 
one to look out for.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.560
<b>I know.</b>

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.360
<b>Luck is trying to cheer him up...</b>

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.680
La, la. Gimme more noms.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.300
My, aren't you a hungry little one?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.260
Marie... Marie... Always Marie.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.230
What's going on over there?

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.170
The Black Bulls, huh?

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.560
I guess bulls will be bulls.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.510
Come on, you guys, stop! 
This is embarrassing!

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.700
Why are you so stiff?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.200
I'm sure this next match

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.500
will be complicated for you, 
given who you're up against.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.310
Uh... Y-Yeah, I guess.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.550
Not to mention, I've never beaten 
my little brother in anything.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.800
Don't worry.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.760
I've fought alongside you, so I know.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.550
You changed after meeting Asta.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.220
The same goes for me.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.810
I was able to face something hidden deep
 within my heart that I'd been ignoring.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.160
You're not going to lose so easily now.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.320
Now get out there and show everyone 
how cool you are. Just like your hair.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.820
Vanessa...

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.930
You've got this, Finral!

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.760
Don't lose like Magna, and come fight me.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.710
Yeah! Don't lose like— 
The hell did you say?!

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.860
I-I'm rooting for you, too!

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.130
You've got this. You've got this. You've got this. 
You've got this. You've got this. You've got this...

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.040
You'd better not embarrass 
the rest of the squad.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.130
Yeah.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.130
Charmy... Even Gauche.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.890
Thanks, you guys. I'm so happy 
I joined the Black Bu—

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.680
Please, more noms.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.730
I want to see Marie as soon as possible, 
so win this in one second.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.330
<i>But I have seniority...</i>

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.760
I'm sure Captain Yami's cheering 
you on from the base, too.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.470
Yeah. He seemed a bit antsy this morning.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.910
He said his stomach was acting up, but...

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.410
I'm sure he just wants to see you 
work hard even without his help.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.910
Those guys must be going beyond their 
limits and kicking ass right about now.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.720
I'm kicking ass, too.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.300
This one's gonna be a killer.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.800
And damn it, kid! I told you to 
restock the damn toilet paper!

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.560
Good grief. As if you could 
actually defeat me, Brother.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.790
Langris, I managed to change 
after meeting my friends.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.140
We'll be the ones who win this.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.150
Whatever. Don't blame me for 
whatever happens, all right?

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.780
Would you let me handle him?

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.680
I don't see why not.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.470
A battle between brothers, eh?

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.140
I also want to fight my 
brother for real one day.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.120
I accept your passionate request!

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.320
Bah-ha!

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.940
I'm going to burn the image 
of me gallantly riding

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.320
my Shooting Star into everyone's eyes!

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.130
You will not lay a single 
finger on our crystal!

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.910
It's finally starting!

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.930
Now I'm getting nervous.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.430
<i>Finral, I know you can win this.</i>

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.570
And now,

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.430
E Team: Leopold, Hamon, and Finral 
versus G Team: Langris, Fragil, and Sekke.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
<b>Fragil</b>

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
<b>Langris</b>

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
<b>Sekke</b>

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
<b>G Team</b>

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
<b>Leopold</b>

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
<b>Finral</b>

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
<b>Hamon</b>

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.190
<b>E Team</b>

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.610
Round two of stage two, begin!

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.910
You two concentrate on 
destroying the enemy crystal.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.980
Leave it to me.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.450
Let's find out where it is.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.590
Glass Magic: Verre Détection.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.460
I can see every inch of this battle stage 
as the light reflects off the glass.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.430
It will take a little while, but I will 
definitely be able to find the enemy's crystal.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.210
I expect you to take me all the way 
to the enemy base again, Mr. Bah-ha.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.950
Leave it to me! Also, I'm Sekke.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.040
Please call me Sekke.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.540
You can even call me Sek, bah-ha.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.360
Understood, Mr. Bah-ha.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.960
Bah-ha. No, really, it's Sekke!

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.700
Please call me Sekke!

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.950
<i>You brought shame upon the House of Vaude.</i>

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.490
<i>There's no way you can defeat me, Brother.</i>

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.840
You see, you aren't my child.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.320
So the only one that I love 
is my dear little Langris.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.470
Mother, it's a bit cruel to be so blunt.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.930
What is that pathetically weak spell?

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.900
Learn from Langris's attack spells!

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.110
Goodness.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.560
I see my dear little Langris is better 
than you at both academics and sports.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.440
You're so amazing, my dear little Langris.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.870
As I should expect from my own child.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.710
What are you doing, Finral?

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.330
You disgrace the Vaude name!

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:28.210
<i>How pathetic. He's older than me, but there's 
not one thing he can do better than me.</i>

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.480
What? A fiancée?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.460
Yes.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:36.740
<b>Finnes Calmreich</b>

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.040
This is Lady Finnes, the fiancée of 
the next head of the House of Vaude.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.770
Good day to you.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.830
Her chronic illness keeps 
her from going out often,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.080
but the king is her great uncle, 
so she comes from a prestigious family

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.560
and has splendid magic.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.750
<i>So basically, in the future, 
this woman and I will...</i>

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.070
<i>Ugh. What a dull-looking woman.</i>

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.240
My dear little Langris, 
make sure you get along with her.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.330
She's going to be your bride someday.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.040
Of course!

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.350
<i>Seriously... When I become 
the lord of this house,</i>

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:16.220
<i>I'll be able to bring us fame 
like they've never seen.</i>

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.030
<i>Ugh... I'm so bored.</i>

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:27.480
I'm very sorry that you got stuck with a 
fiancée who's sickly and older than you.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.840
N-Not at all! 
You're b-b-beautiful, Miss Finnes.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.320
It's just... I'm not the one who'll become 
the next head of the House of Vaude.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.690
Huh?

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.190
My little brother is better 
at everything than me,

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.290
so he'll be able to make you happy.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.800
His magic is amazing, 
and he's a very decisive person.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.420
I'm just a failure.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.760
<i>Exactly. There's not a single 
thing he can beat me i—</i>

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.260
That's not true.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.260
<i>Huh?</i>

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.270
I've only met you a few times, but I can tell.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.250
You're a very kind person.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.020
To me, you're a much more 
wonderful mage, Finral.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.940
O-Oh, stop! D-Don't tease me like that!

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.630
Oh, but I wasn't teasing you at all.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.250
<i>Who do you think you are, you dull woman?</i>

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.740
<i>You have the nerve to call me 
inferior to my brother?</i>

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.560
<i>Don't be ridiculous.</i>

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.750
<i>That loser left the family because 
he couldn't handle the pressure.</i>

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.120
<i>He's not better than me at anything!
Not a single thing!</i>

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.500
Bah-ha! Found it!

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.120
Here he comes. As we planned, 
we'll leave him to you, Finral.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.550
Just as a reminder...
Don't blame me if you lose any limbs.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.430
I'll end this in a single blow!

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.560
What?!

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.940
I tested this out earlier with another 
spatial magic user, Cob, and found out...

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.530
that when spatial magics collide,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.020
the mana currents collide 
and cancel each other out!

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.160
Langris, we're the ones who are going to win!

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.050
Th-That's awesome!

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.510
You can cancel out spatial 
magic with spatial magic?

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.620
Way to go, Finral!

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.160
H-He's like a completely different person!

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.660
Keep it up, ya jerk!

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.200
Marie's waiting. Hurry up and win.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.920
I get to have more yummy noms, la!

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.400
Bah-ha, ha-bah?!

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.070
Excellent work, Finral! That was effective!

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.410
Hamon, where's the enemy team's crystal?

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.000
I've finally found it!

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.960
It's deep within that tower.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.460
All right, I'm counting on you two!

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.800
Th-This isn't good, bah-ha!

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.300
Who do you think you are, Brother? 
I'll remind you of your place!

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.890
Give it up!

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.020
You came in.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.400
This is...

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.900
Snow Magic: Phantom Snow Garden.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.510
This spell forces your senses to sleep.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.160
You cannot attack me effectively any longer.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.390
I'm not tired at all... This is nothing!

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:45.420
Especially compared to my older sister's 
training, which could leave you dead!

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.680
Honestly, you still have much to learn.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.930
Yeah! You're so valiant, Hamon!

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.860
I can still eat plenty...

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.560
You're talking about yourself?!

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.900
You should give up and fall asleep, too.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.900
This is...

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.280
I swore upon the symbol on my forehead...

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.740
that I would surpass my brother someday!

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.700
And that means I can't lose in a place like this!

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.410
Concentrate!

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.220
Mana Skin!

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.420
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.700
<i>His senses are sharp!</i>

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.180
<i>He enveloped himself in mana 
and canceled my spell.</i>

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.680
<i>More! I need to concentrate more!</i>

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.190
I won't last much longer, Langris.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.360
Bah-ha!

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:55.180
A spatial magic battle! 
You don't see that every day!

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.000
Ah, so that is Finnes's fiancé, Langris.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.970
Not bad at all.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.670
He's still no match for me, though.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.320
Keep it up, Finral!

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.970
It's only a matter of time before 
their crystal is destroyed!

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.510
I never thought you'd become 
my natural enemy, Brother.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.600
Do you plan on defending 
until our crystal breaks?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.520
I'm not sure that'll be so easy!

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.520
It might not be. That's why...

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.400
I'm going to use a new spell!

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.660
Bah-ha! What in the world is that slow spell?

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.510
Like you could hit my badass self right now!

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.250
<i>What? Homing?</i>

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.890
That's no match for my invincible 
Sekke Magnum Cannonball!

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.970
H-He disappeared?!

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.560
This is pretty pathetic, even for me.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.480
I trained so hard, but I never 
could learn a single attack spell.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.480
It's not an attack spell?

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.080
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.120
It follows the enemy, 
and once it makes contact,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.890
it transports them to another location.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.950
It's the applied version of 
the spell I usually use.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:22.070
This way, he can get rid of 
enemies without hurting them!

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.170
He must be a kind soul.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.150
You're so awesome, Finral!

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.760
B-But where did he go?

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.980
It just went back in. Can I kill you now?

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.980
<i>Bah-ha... I'm dead.</i>

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.110
Langris, it's only a matter of time 
before your crystal is destroyed.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.280
I don't want to hurt you!

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.790
If you insist on continuing, I'll have 
to use this spell to make you leave.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.770
<i>Who</i> are you worried about?

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.520
You constantly get on my nerves, Brother.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.090
Who would've thought that our special 
reserve spells would be similar?

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.360
How dare you make me use my grimoire's magic?!

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:41.790
There isn't a single thing 
you can beat me at, Brother!

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.040
<i>Th-This ominous feeling... 
I've felt this somewhere before!</i>

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.130
Th-This mana...

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.380
This is...

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.890
This doesn't feel very pleasant.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.640
<i>As I figured...</i>

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.640
It's over, Brother!

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.390
Langris!

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:12.490
Th-This immense magical power... 
I already know I don't stand a chance.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.150
But this is...

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.160
This nauseating magic is like...

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.160
Who are you?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.980
Finral!

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.870
If that attack hits him...

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:25.950
Run!

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.830
No. He's Langris.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.210
He's my little brother.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.340
You may not like it, but we're similar.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.590
Our mothers are different, but in the end...

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.090
I never did anything that made 
me seem like a big brother.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.850
I left our family and tried 
to forget everything.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.630
But I just couldn't. 
Langris, no matter what you think...

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.980
You're my little brother!

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.370
Langris, stop it! If you keep this up, 
I have a feeling you won't be you anymore!

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.230
What could you possibly 
know about me, Brother?

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.410
You left everything behind!

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.630
You're a coward who can't even hurt people!

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.390
Don't you dare try to act 
like my big brother now!

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.890
I'll stop you!

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.040
Finral!

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.540
G-G Team wins!

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.640
How do you like that? 
There's nothing you can beat me at!

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.080
Young Master Finral is so friendly and kind, 
isn't he? He has a lot of friends, too.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:19.700
Young Master Langris is... Well, it's obvious
 that he looks down on people, you know?

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.570
To me, you're a much more 
wonderful mage, Finral.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.830
<i>Even I want someone that kind to...</i>

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.330
Langris!

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.480
Working too hard all the time 
hurts after a while, doesn't it?

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.630
Come goof off with your 
big brother once in a while!

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.010
There's a festival going on nearby!

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.550
<i>Why is he nice to me, too?</i>

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.680
<i>Stop it.</i>

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.580
Learn from Langris!

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.810
My dear little Langris is so amazing.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.670
<i>I'm better than you are. That's why 
Mother and Father are kind to me.</i>

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:02.190
<i>I have to beat him at everything! 
Otherwise, I'll... I'll...</i>

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.550
Hey, the match is over.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.700
Wh-What's he doing?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.500
Disappear.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.180
Finral!

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.560
<i>These wounds are awful.</i>

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.850
<i>At this rate...</i>

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.270
Hey!

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.270
Just try and do something else.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.110
Forget the match. We'll kill you.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.240
You bastard...

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.190
How dare you do that to Finral?!

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.500
Th-This is too awful!

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.990
You actually pissed me off.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.490
I won't forgive you!

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.120
Oh?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.490
There's something wrong with you!

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.150
The match was already over!

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.680
<b>Petit Clover</b>

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.460
Petit Clover!

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:38.180
<b>Hairstyle</b>

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.170
Hairstyle.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.520
That new spell is awesome! 
Fallen Angel's Weightlifting!

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.030
That's Fallen Angel's Wingbeat.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.980
I mean, I know when I need to get tough.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.830
It's the result of trying different things.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:55.740
So is your new hairstyle also 
from trying different things?

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.070
Oh, really?

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.290
Huh? Wait, no...

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.970
I'm sure you tried out a regent pompadour.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.780
As well as Captain Yami's hairstyle.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.040
And soft serve hair, la!

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.080
That's poo—

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.130
This looks pretty strong!

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.930
If you do Marie's hairstyle, I'll kill you.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.810
I-I like this hairstyle.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.850
I think this one is better.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.030
I-It's just a better option, that's all.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.800
How about something a bit more mature?

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.650
This is the hairstyle for when 
you go beyond your limits!

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.390
Uh, seriously...

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.780
I wanted to see this 
hairstyle on you, Finral!

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.310
When it comes to me in this series, 
my hair should be the least of your worries!

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.120
Praise me!

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.870
Your daring and resolute king presents...

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:47.790
Next time on <i>Black Clover</i>, Page 81:
"The Life of a Certain Man."

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:50.390
Page 81

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.630
Praise me!
